## üìù An Interesting Article: **"You Are Not Google"**  

I recently read an insightful article titled **["You Are Not Google"]((https://blog.bradfieldcs.com/you-are-not-google-84912cf44afb))** by **Oz Nova (Bradfield)**. The article challenges the common tendency for software developers to over-engineer systems by trying to implement **Google-scale solutions** for problems that don‚Äôt require such complexity.

## üí° What I Found Interesting  

Many developers are fascinated by the cutting-edge architectures used by **tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon**. While these companies deal with **massive scale and extreme performance requirements**, most businesses and startups do not need such **highly complex, distributed systems**. The article highlights how developers often over-engineer solutions, choosing **microservices, complex database sharding, and eventual consistency** when a **simpler monolithic architecture** would be far more practical.  

One of the key takeaways from the article is that **simplicity is underrated in software engineering**. Instead of prematurely optimizing for scale, developers should focus on **building maintainable, efficient, and easy-to-understand solutions**. The best architecture is the one that **fits the actual needs of the business**, not the one that looks the most impressive on a r√©sum√©.  

This article is a great reminder that **engineering should always be pragmatic**‚Äîjust because Google does something a certain way doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the right choice for your project! üöÄ

Great point! I agree that simplicity is often ignored in software development. Many developers try to use big-tech solutions without really needing them. Your view on focusing on practical and useful engineering is a great reminder. I also find an ariticle that emphasizes the same perspective that nowaday's software engineering needs more pratical and soft skills in order to make a successful project. Well said! 

## Commented by Yinqi Wang(Yinqi596):
I absolutely agree with your opinion that simplicity is underrated in software engineering, nowdays programmers use complicated tools and algorithms to show their skills, but this is quite unnecessary. Using the most common solutions is a best way to save time and energy and make the programs more readable for everyone else.
