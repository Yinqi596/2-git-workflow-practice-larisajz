## 📝 An Interesting Article: **"You Are Not Google"**  

I recently read an insightful article titled **["You Are Not Google"]([https://oz-nova.github.io/you-are-not-google/](https://blog.bradfieldcs.com/you-are-not-google-84912cf44afb))** by **Oz Nova (Bradfield)**. The article challenges the common tendency for software developers to over-engineer systems by trying to implement **Google-scale solutions** for problems that don’t require such complexity.

## 💡 What I Found Interesting  

Many developers are fascinated by the cutting-edge architectures used by **tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon**. While these companies deal with **massive scale and extreme performance requirements**, most businesses and startups do not need such **highly complex, distributed systems**. The article highlights how developers often over-engineer solutions, choosing **microservices, complex database sharding, and eventual consistency** when a **simpler monolithic architecture** would be far more practical.  

One of the key takeaways from the article is that **simplicity is underrated in software engineering**. Instead of prematurely optimizing for scale, developers should focus on **building maintainable, efficient, and easy-to-understand solutions**. The best architecture is the one that **fits the actual needs of the business**, not the one that looks the most impressive on a résumé.  

This article is a great reminder that **engineering should always be pragmatic**—just because Google does something a certain way doesn’t mean it’s the right choice for your project! 🚀
